你好！ I am currently a first year M.S. student in the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/index.htm), supervised by [Prof. Shaohua Kevin Zhou](http://bme.ustc.edu.cn/2021/1115/c28129a532912/page.htm). I am proud to be a member of [MIRACLE Lab 奇迹实验室](https://miracle.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm).

My research interest lies in computer vision and machine learning with applications for medical imaging. Recently I focus on elaborating neural network design for undersampled MRI reconstruction.
