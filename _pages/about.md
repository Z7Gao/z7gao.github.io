欢迎您来！Welcome! I am currently a first year M.S. student in the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/index.htm), supervised by [Prof. Shaohua Kevin Zhou](http://bme.ustc.edu.cn/2021/1115/c28129a532912/page.htm). I am proud to be a member of [MIRACLE Lab 奇迹实验室](https://miracle.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm).

I am broadly interested in computer vision and machine learning with applications for medical imaging. Recently I focus on elaborating neural network backbones for undersampled MRI reconstruction. My current research interest includes elaborating tiny and efficient deep learning model, vision transformer, network backbone design and theoretical analysis, DDPM, mostly intrigued by my previous work.
