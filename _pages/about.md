欢迎您来！Welcome! I am currently a first year M.S. student in the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/index.htm), supervised by [Prof. Shaohua Kevin Zhou](http://bme.ustc.edu.cn/2021/1115/c28129a532912/page.htm). I am proud to be a member of [MIRACLE Lab 奇迹实验室](https://miracle.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm).

My research interest includes undersampled MRI reconstruction and MRI generation. I have experienced in developing methodology with Vision Transformers and diffusion models.

I am passionate about advancing biomedical imaging for both clinical and scientific purposes using generative models. Free free to reach me out at [email](gaozqqd@gmail.com) if we have shared interest.
