Efficient Image Collection for the Mapper Robot II
-----
* [project page](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/node/308)
* A project of the Robotics 2020 class of the School of Information Science and Technology (SIST) of ShanghaiTech University.
* Course Instructor: [Prof. Sören Schwertfeger](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/people/soeren).
* To avoid the limitation of the ROS transmission bandwidths on the second version of the MARS Mapper Robot dataset collection, this project is to develop a new image compression method which can produce fast and highquality image compression and saving.

C-based Emulator of RISC-V ISA
---
* A project of the [Computer Architecture 2021](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/courses/ca/21s/) class of the School of Information Science and Technology (SIST) of ShanghaiTech University.
* Course Instructor: [Prof. Sören Schwertfeger](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/people/soeren).
* This project implements a disassembler that reproduces the original RISC-V instructions from 32-bit integer in a human-readable format and executes each instruction including performing memory accesses.
