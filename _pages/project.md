[High Performance Image Collection for the Mapper Robot II](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/node/308)
-----
  * A project of the Robotics 2020 class of the School of Information Science and Technology (SIST) of ShanghaiTech University.
  * Course Instructor: [Prof. Sören Schwertfeger](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/people/soeren).
  * To avoid the limitation of the ROS transmission bandwidths on the second version of the MARS Mapper Robot dataset collection, this project is to develop a new image compression method which can produce fast and highquality image compression and saving.

Single View 3D Hand Pose Estimation Enhanced by Electromyographic (EMG) Signals
---
  * Research project involved when I was in [Dr. Yuyao Zhang](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/_t113/2020/0814/c7582a54827/page.htm)'s lab.
  * Duties:
    * Sets up and validates a synchronized data collection system of both EMG signals and images.
    * Develops a Python toolkit for data pre-processing and visualization with several gesture recognition methods, including traditional machine learning algorithms and neural network, implemented.
    * Observes that hard pose estimation with self-occlusion show typical patterns in EMG signals.

High-Resolution MR Image Reconstruction via Implicit Neural Representation
---
  * Research project involved when I was in [Dr. Yuyao Zhang](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/_t113/2020/0814/c7582a54827/page.htm)'s lab.
  * Duties:
    * Fast prototype ideas for a robust unsupervised MRI reconstruction algorithm based on neural implicit representation.
    * Carry out experiments on self-acquired QSM images.
    * Cooperate with Ph.Ds instructed by [Prof. Garth Thompson](https://ihuman.shanghaitech.edu.cn/Garth/main.htm) in mouse knee MR imaging.

C-based Emulator of RISC-V ISA
---
  * A project of the [Computer Architecture 2021](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/courses/ca/21s/) class of the School of Information Science and Technology (SIST) of ShanghaiTech University.
  * Course Instructor: [Prof. Sören Schwertfeger](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/people/soeren).
  * This project implements a disassembler that reproduces the original RISC-V instructions from 32-bit integer in a human-readable format and executes each instruction including performing memory accesses.
