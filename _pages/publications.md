[High Performance Image Collection for the Mapper Robot II](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/node/308)
-----
  * A project of the Robotics 2020 class of the School of Information Science and Technology (SIST) of ShanghaiTech University.
  * Course Instructor: [Prof. SÃ¶ren Schwertfeger](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/people/soeren).
  * To avoid the limitation of the ROS transmission bandwidths on the second version of the MARS Mapper Robot dataset collection, this project develops a new image compression method which can produce fast and highquality image compression and saving.
