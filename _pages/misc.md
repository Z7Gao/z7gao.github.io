Creativity & Hobbies

* I write scripts occasionally and use videography for recoding and interacting. 
  ** One of the best experiences in my undergraduate life is learning playwriting from [Peter Robinson](https://cinema.usc.edu/faculty/profile.cfm?id=37990&first=&last=&title=&did=19&startrow=31), the Hollywood screenwriter and Associate Professor of USC Cinematics Arts, and my teacher and close friend [Yijun Zhu](https://sca.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sca_en/2019/0829/c7939a57104/page.htm). It is the help of them and my classmates that let me finish my first 10-page script and film [it](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-4IQhBYNrZBAyvwGHLkQaw)!

  ** I am fortunate to make one ([video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CS4y1H7vv/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=d8c36cb3685bcc240aff19de7171f03e), [music](https://y.music.163.com/m/song?app_version=8.7.85&id=1961852698&uct=jO+IrX7F/0YQWnsNDUfjOQ%3D%3D&dlt=0846)) as a gift representing SISTors of Class 2018. Without the help of my briliant friends who are skilled in lyrics writting, photography, graphic design, music production, film editing, and performing, respectively, I would never have managed to make such a graduation video during the CoVID-19 lockdown of Shanghai. 


* In my spare time, I enjoy making pour-over coffee. Making a nice cup of pour-over coffee is similar to designing a strong neural network: it requires a deep understanding of different parameters deciding gases, tastes and mouthfeel (function of neural network building blocks), coffee bean (distinctive learning tasks), and a lot of trials and errors (experiments).
