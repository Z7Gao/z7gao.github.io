Hobbies

* I write scripts occasionally and use videography for recoding and interacting. 
  * One of the best experiences in my undergraduate life is learning playwriting from [Peter Robinson](https://cinema.usc.edu/faculty/profile.cfm?id=37990&first=&last=&title=&did=19&startrow=31), the Hollywood screenwriter and associate professor of USC Cinematics Arts, and my teacher and close friend [Yijun Zhu](https://sca.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sca_en/2019/0829/c7939a57104/page.htm). Watching a film is enjoyable, while writing a script is painful. It is a journey where the complexity of human nature needs to be understood with empathy and revealed methodically; introspection and breakdown happen repeatedly. Without the help of them and my classmates, I could never finish my first 10-page script and film [it](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-4IQhBYNrZBAyvwGHLkQaw) to the entire university!

  * I am proud to make a graduation video ([video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CS4y1H7vv/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=d8c36cb3685bcc240aff19de7171f03e), [music](https://y.music.163.com/m/song?app_version=8.7.85&id=1961852698&uct=jO+IrX7F/0YQWnsNDUfjOQ%3D%3D&dlt=0846)) as a gift representing [SISTors](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/main.psp) of Class 2018 as the core script writter, producer, director, film editor, music recorder... (We were so short of hand then!!) I am fortunate to have many briliant friends who are skilled in lyrics writting, photography, graphic design, music production, film editing, and performing, respectively. Without whom, I would never have managed to make such a cool video during the CoVID-19 lockdown of Shanghai. 


* In my spare time, I enjoy making pour-over coffee. 
  * Random thinking about coffee and research: Making a nice cup of pour-over coffee is similar to designing a strong neural network. It requires a deep understanding of different parameters deciding gases, tastes and mouthfeel (function of neural network building blocks), coffee bean (distinctive learning tasks), and a lot of trials and errors (experiments).
