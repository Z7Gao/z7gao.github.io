By taking effectiveness and efficiency into account, we propose a CNN-ViT hybrid model DuDoRNeXt that achieves SoTA performance under multiple conventions of undersampled MRI reconstruction on several datasets including the IXI dataset. We propse a novel hybridizing strategy for vertical layout design and propose domain-specifc modules that further boost its performance.
